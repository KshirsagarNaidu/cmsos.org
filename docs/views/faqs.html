<h3>CMSOS FAQs</h3> <ol> <li> <h4>Is Choice Members Site Owners Society (CMSOS) registered with Government Authority?</h4> Yes, it is registered with Government of Karnataka under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960. Reg. No: DRO/SJN/SOR/61/2015-16.</li> <li> <h4>What gave birth to CMSOS?</h4> Over the years, we became increasingly frustrated with the administration of the affairs at CM, particularly with regard to matters relating to collection of dues by the association from its members, the utilization of the finances in an injudicious way for the benefit of only a select group of members, imposition of unrealistic and unlawful requirements for the members to exercise their voting rights (majority of whom live remotely), lack of a common platform for free communication of the members amongst themselves for dissemination of important information with transparency and honesty. Open and gross discrimination between residents and non-residents, coercion for collection of alleged dues which were never bound by any agreement, forcing members to pay club-house charges to maintain their voting rights and many other contentious issues remained unresolved. Over and over again, our repeated pleas and attempts to collaborate with the association’s office bearers failed due to the obstinate attitude and selfish interests of some of its officials. The dream to transform the existing association to one that would handle the finances judiciously and utilize the funds for the overall development of the community, rather than for the benefit of a few of its members thus remained elusive. A genuine need for a fair representation of the site owners in the decision making process of the executive committee was strongly felt, and a culmination of all the stated aspirations, thoughts and actions led to the formation of CMSOS.</li> <li> <h4>What are the core values of CMSOS?</h4> DAC - Democracy, Accountability and Conscientiousness</li> <li> <h4>What is the vision of CMSOS?</h4> <p>Our ultimate aim is to enhance the value of your site and improve the general infrastructure, which can be achieved once we have sufficient members in CMSOS.</p> <p>Some of the ideas and projects for future consideration are installation of solar street lighting, provision of good roads, drainage, viable security, favourable negotiation for well-equipped working Club House run and maintained by Ferns Builders and Developers (who own the club house) with a position of strength instead of being at the receiving ends, and facilitating the regularization of the plots by the relevant government bodies (considering options such as DC Conversion or BBMP takeover of common infrastructure and public utilities depending on the collective decision of the majority of the members). </p> </li> <li> <h4>How does joining CMSOS benefit me?</h4> By joining CMSOS, you will have a definite say in the administration of your society working for welfare and investment. Your yearly maintenance expenses will be significantly lower than what you’ve been paying. Your money will be spent judiciously for the purpose it was collected and every expense will be accounted for. A reporting system will be in place to periodically brief you on the activities that took place. More importantly, you can be rest assured that the society will work for you and not for any individual or group of individuals’ interest.</li> <li> <h4>What kind of services does CMSOS provide?</h4> To list a few, in the beginning we will keep a watchful eye on the sites. We will also provide for to periodically trim the over-growth in your plot by local arrangements, until we have enough members in the association to allow delegation of the work to an external service provider. If you provide us with the survey numbers of your plot, we will periodically check the records available at the Bhoomi website (which requires knowledge of Kannada) for any suspicious transactions, encumbrance, mortgage or illegal sale.</li> <li> <h4>Does my site require utilities like water and electricity?</h4> In the present state, your site does not require water and electricity.</li> <li> <h4>How do I get water if I have to construct a house?</h4> The present situation in CM is that you have to make your own arrangements for water for any construction purposes and it will have to be delivered to the construction site by tanker.</li> <li> <h4>If I live in CM where do I get water from for my day to day consumption?</h4> In CM the bore wells are not pumping sufficient water and what is being supplied to the residents is a trickle. In fact some residents do not depend on this erratic supply and are getting water by tankers for their day to day needs.</li> <li> <h4>Will the water situation improve?</h4> The situation will improve only when the CM comes under BBMP and it gets connected to the public water supply system like Cauvery water.</li> <li> <h4>Is electricity available if I construct my house and start living in CM?</h4> Yes, it is available. BESCOM provides electric connection to anyone who needs it.</li> <li> <h4>Does my house plan need to be approved by CMSOS?</h4> No, CMSOS has no objection with what you intend to do with your plot/investment and how you build, as long your plans are approved by the law of the land governed by the concerned statutory Government Authority. You are also advised to keep in view the BBMP rules to avoid unnecessary and expensive modifications as eventually it is expected that the layouts will come under their jurisdiction.</li> <li> <h4>Do I need to be a member of CM Club?</h4> The club is owned by Ferns Builders and Developers, the membership subscription is collected by FBD and they manage it directly or indirectly. CMSOS has no say in this, it is your individual preference and decision, if you want to be a member or not. When we have sufficient members in CMSOS, we will urge FBD to equip and modernize the CM Club improving from its present pathetic state.</li> <li> <h4>Will CMSOS improve the general infrastructure of CM?</h4> Please see the answer for question 4.</li> <li> <h4>How do I join CMSOS?</h4> A letter or email (to <a href="mailto:CMSOS2015@yahoo.com?subject=Interested in Joining CMSOS">CMSOS2015@yahoo.com</a>) is required from you stating that you would like to join CMSOS and you should mention in the letter that “you have read and understood the CMSOS Bye Laws and agree to abide by it”.
